# Newsprint

This is my final project that I completed for my Web Publishing class, a class focused on PHP Web Development.

Newsprint is a MySQL database driven faux online webstore selling new and used comic books. Users can create an account, view and edit their account information, browse/search/sort products, add items to a shopping cart, and view their past and pending orders.

Admin accounts are toggled in the database. Admins can add/edit products and product images, manage inventory, and manage past and pending orders in the admin panel.

This project was meant to highlight understanding of secure Database connections, form handling with GET, POST, and REQUEST, input validation, SESSION variable usage, and dynamic content generation.
